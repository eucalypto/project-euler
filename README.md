# Project Euler

This is my place to play with the Project Euler problems.

## Why?

I like working on the problems of Project Euler.
But usually I take breaks from it for months. 
This is where a documentation is valuable.
I have been using Dynalist as my main note taking app and have a project there.
It works decent but git is still better at managing and versioning code. 
So I will gradually bring my solved solutions to this repository.

## Notes

### Current set-up

Currently, I put my notes into `Readme.md` files in the folder of the problems.

### Old set-up

I wanted to try out the issue capabilities of gitlab and opened an issue for each problem. Unfortunately, those issues are not part of the repository. Although they are as easy to use as modern forum software.
